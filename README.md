Develop dwell time model for King County and San Francisco

## content
This repository suggests dwell time model specifications for bus systems in the Puget Sound Region (King County Metro) and the San Francisco Bay Area (Muni, operated by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, SFMTA). 
For other bus transit operators and non-bus transit modes, an inferred dwell time specification is suggested based on the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM)


Model specification recommendations balance estimation robustness and reasonableness while retaining desired policy levers. 
San Franciscoâ€™s suggested policy levers include standard versus articulated buses, low-floor vehicles, and all-door boarding policy.  
In the Puget Sound, the recommended policy variables include off-board fare payment and vehicle type.
